 ### Project Description:
 
 This project develops an AI-powered waste classification system using the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model. It automates the process of classifying waste as Recyclable or Non-recyclable, enabling efficient waste segregation. The solution includes a REST API for real-time image classification, supporting better recycling practices and reducing environmental impact.

### The Problem Statement:
 
 Improper waste segregation leads to inefficient recycling, increased pollution, and resource wastage. Manual sorting is labor-intensive and error-prone. This project provides an automated system to accurately classify waste, improving waste management and promoting sustainability.

 ### The Solution:
 
The solution is an AI-powered system that uses a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model to classify waste as Recyclable or Non-recyclable based on images. It includes a Flask-based REST API for real-time classification, enabling easy integration into smart waste management systems to improve recycling efficiency and reduce environmental impact.

Waste Classification Using MobileNetV2
### Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model that classifies waste into two categories: Recyclable and Non-recyclable. Using a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model, this solution enables quick and accurate waste classification. The project also includes a REST API for easy integration and real-time image classification.

Dataset

The dataset must be organized in the following structure:

dataset/

â”œâ”€â”€ train/

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ recyclable/# Images of recyclable waste

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ non-recyclable/ # Images of non-recyclable waste

â””â”€â”€ test/
    â”œâ”€â”€ recyclable/ 
    â””â”€â”€ non-recyclable/

Download public datasets like TrashNet or Kaggle Waste Classification.
Each category folder should contain relevant images (e.g., recyclable materials like plastic bottles, and non-recyclable materials like food waste).
Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the Repository git clone <repository-url>
cd WasteClassification
2. Set Up Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install Dependencies
pip install tensorflow numpy pillow flask
4. Prepare the Dataset
Place your dataset in the dataset/ folder, organized as shown in the Dataset section.
Usage

Training the Model
1. Run the waste_classifier.py script:
python  waste_classifier.py
2. The trained model will be saved as waste_classifier.h5.
Testing the Model
1. Open the classify.py script.
2. Replace the test_image_path with the path to your test image.
3. Run the script:
python classify.py
4. Output Example:
Classification Result: Recyclable
